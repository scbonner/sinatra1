Inside your sinatra1 directory on Cloud9, create a 
views directory.  Within that, create two .erb files.
The first should be howmany.erb, and it should be a 
form that asks the user to enter the number of candles.
It should use the /candles action and the post method.
The second .erb file would be candles.erb, and it 
should display as many candles as the user requests.  
Then add the get ‘/howmany’ and post ‘/candles’ blocks
in sinatra1.rb.  Then try it out, to see if you can 
display the requested number of candles.
